# Arch-Simple-Install
Basic arch install script. Asks for input on things like hostname, locale, partitioning, etc. Fork to personalize script for own needs.
WARNING: Does not work for nvme drives since the naming scheme for the partitions is not as simple as, for example, /dev/sda1 for disk /dev/sda.
